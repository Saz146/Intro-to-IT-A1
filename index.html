				<h1>Interest In Information Technology</h1>
				<p>My interest in Information Technology arises from my experience using technology every day. I have been interested in Information Technology ever since I was in primary school, and I have always been a fan of this Industry.  I use information technology for many purposes. For instance, I use my laptop and phone for online shopping, as it makes it more convenient to purchase products. Through my daily use of social media, I stay connected with people that mean most to me in my life. I have also used information technology for educational purposes such as research for school projects. From experiences like those I have stated, I have learned that Information Technology is very important for not just me, but for the whole world.</p>


        <p>I want to learn the impacts that technology that can have on society, both the positives and the negatives. I want to learn about how Information Technology works and get involved in things like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. I am also interested in the rapidity at which technology is evolving and how it will look in the future. Aside from my experience using technology every day, I have also been influenced by other factors in my life. Notably, I am interested in the business magnate Elon Musk and his company Neuralink’s endeavours into Information Technology. Specifically, I am intrigued by their device that can translate an individual’s thoughts into action using a chip implanted into the brain of a human.  Television shows and movies, such as “Mr Robot” and “Ex Machina” are also a factor that have garnered my interest into Information Technology. These shows involve many components of technology such as cyber-security and Artificial Intelligence, which are very crucial in this modern day and age.</p>

        <p>The Myers-Briggs test tells me that I have a Consul personality type, meaning I am a social person and like to be updated on what my friends are doing. It also tells me that I enjoy supporting those around me and that I try my best to make sure that everyone around me is doing well. The results say that I am more extraverted than introverted. IT also tells me that I am both an intuitive and observant person. The Myers-Briggs test also tells me I am more of a judgemental person, rather than a prospecting person. Finally, the results say that I am more of an assertive person rather than a turbulent person. Overall, I believe these results are partly true because I do care about my friends and what they do, but I would not say I am always a social person. There are times I like to do things on my own, without others, but there are also times where I am willing to be with other people. I believe I am more of an introvert than an extrovert, but I do agree with other parts of the test such as being an assertive person.</p>

        <p>For the IPIP Big Five Factors test I have been labelled as a person with high consciousness, agreeableness, and emotional stability. I have been tested mid-range for extroversion and intellect/imagination. I think these results are reasonable as they show that I am a person that thinks well and that I am aware of my surroundings. It also shows that I can handle things emotionally and provide reason for my actions. The results also show that although I am not the most imaginative person, I still have some creative thinking I can apply daily. </p>

        <p>The final test that I did was the learning styles test. This test checks what type of learner I am from the three styles of learning: visual, kinesthetic, and auditory. Visual style is learning by seeing, kinesthetic is learning by doing things, and auditory is learning by hearing.  For the Learning Styles Test, I have been told that Visual is my primary learning style. According to the results, I am 35% a visual learner, 33% a kinesthetic learner and 32% an auditory learner. To be honest, I think I am more of a kinesthetic learner since I learn mostly by doing things and getting hands-on experience, rather than just looking at someone else demonstrating something to me. I agree with the test result that the learning style I relate to the least is auditory, because I do not learn the most from hearing things. Although the results say that Visual is my primary style of learning, I believe this test shows that I am do not have a specific learning style because the percentages are almost evenly spread out. I think not having a specific learning style is great because I can learn not only in one way, but in three ways.</p>
        <p>The results from these three tests might influence my behaviour in a team because it will allow me think about the strengths that I have such as my intuition and my assertiveness. I think the results say would use more visual methods of learning when working with my team. I believe my teammates would find me easy to communicate with and easy to work effectively with. I know that emotional stability and communication is very crucial for collaborative projects. I think my results show that I will behave well in a team, and I would make a great positive impact on the members in my group. I think that I will help my team achieve our goals and at the end of our work, we will be in a great position. </p>
        <p>When forming a team, I would take many factors into account. For instance, I would like if the members of my team have different attributes to me so then we can be an all-rounded team. I would like members that have great creative thinking skill so that our projects and assignments really stand out. The results from the tests show that I would want people who care for others in my group. I would like If my team members cared for one another. I want my team not to just get our work done, but to work together happily and successfully.</p>

    <h1>Overview</h1>
      <p> The Information Technology project will be a fitness tracker. The fitness tracker will track the fitness progress of the individual as they continue to train for a period of time. The project will be made using a programming language such as Python or through a tool such as an app inventor. This idea is innovative and will be very useful to gym attendees.
Each time the individual finishes a set, they will enter the details of the set, such as the weight and reps of an exercise. The information will be entered using speech-to-text which is an innovative way of inputting information. After the individual records the information, then they can save it. In their next session they can see their previous workout information. By doing this, the individual can track their progression and see if they are achieving their fitness goals. </p>

          <h1>Motivation</h1>
            <p> The project will be useful for gym goers because it will help them with their fitness goals. If the gym goer knows how much they have improved in their fitness; it will satisfy them. The goal of this application is to satisfy its customers, and by enabling valuable information to be recorded, the goal will be reached. This project will be important because a survey by Finder revealed that in 2020, around 6.2 million (32%) have a gym membership. This highlights that there would be a substantial market for a fitness tracker with a speech-to-text function. The project is interesting because it is a new take on fitness apps. Fitness tracker apps are not known for having voice recognition so this will be something original.  </p>

                <h1>Features </h1>
                  <p> As stated before, this application will be produced using a programming language or an app inventor. These factors are important because the product can not be made without them.
The product will have a blue background to increase the appearance of the app. Since the appearance is so crucial, it is important that the design of the app is sophisticated. A blue background would look much better than a blank background. If the background where to be blank, then it would be dull. The avoidance of colour would decrease the user’s desire to use the app. Therefore, colour will be used in the application so that the design looks appealing and vivid.
The use of menus and buttons is used throughout many websites and applications worldwide. Menus and buttons give the user a sense of orientation, which means that the users will always know where to go depending on what they want to do. The fitness tracker app will have menus and buttons in it so that it is easier for the user to navigate through the application. The app will also record the date of the workout once the workout is entered into the system.

The product will have a “Previous Stats” menu, where the individual can see the information that they have previously stored on the application, to compare it with their recent progress. There will also be an “Add Stats” menu where the individual can add their most recent workout information and then save it. This information will be stored in the “Previous Stats Menu” after it is saved. There will be an “Add Workout” button where the individual will be able to utilise the speech-to-text function to input their workout information. There will also be a “Delete” button so that the individual can remove workout information if they desire to. There will also be two “Return” buttons so that the individual can go back to the main menu. There will be an “Exit” button so that the user can leave the program at any time they wish. It is crucial for there to be an exit button as the user must not be restricted and they must always have the freedom to leave the application whenever they please.

    <h1>Tools and Technologies</h1>
    <p> There are software and hardware that are necessary for the development of this product. The hardware required would be a laptop with at least an intel i5 central processing unit or equivalent. The laptop would also require at least 8gb of RAM. The reason this hardware is needed is so that the laptop is suitable and does not slow down the production of the fitness tracker application. A strong internet connection is also necessary so that production of the application will not be compromised. A charger for the laptop is also necessary so then the battery will not run out of charge and slow down production of the application.
The software required would be an open-source speech recognition system such as “DeepSpeech”. The language that will be supported is English as that is the most commonly spoken language in Australia.

  <h1>Skills Required</h1>
    <p>The skills required are experience with a programming language such as python. This is because the program might need to be written using code and it would be efficient if someone with experience with programming coded the application. Experience with an app inventor might also be useful because the fitness tracker might need to be made using an app inventor, so it would be handy to have skills and pre-existing knowledge about app inventors. Skills with implementing speech-to-text in applications will also be useful because this is a crucial part of this information technology project. Overall, the skills required are not overly complex. IT would be feasible to find the hardware and software required for the project.  </p>

  <h1>Outcome</h1>
    <p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be a user-friendly fitness tracker that gym goers can use to track their progress, while utilizing voice recognition. The original problem of not having a fitness tracker with a speech-to-text function will be solved. Roughly 6.2 million Australians who go to the gym, will now have the ability to track their fitness progress using speech-to-text on their devices. This development would have a substantial impact on the fitness industry because it changes the way that millions of people could track their fitness progress. </p>
